Requirements
============
Created with QT4.3.4
Tested with QT4.3.2
Maybe should work with other QT4 versions

Basic Installation
==================
    
    These are generic installation instructions.

    There is no 'configure' shell script, `cause this package is just 
a draft. And it intended for developers rather then for end-users.  
There is a  'qtermwidget.pro'  file  provided instead. 
This file is used for generating Makefiles in each appropriate 
directory via 'qmake' program.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `qmake'.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  

  4. You can remove generated Makefiles form the directory 
     by typing `make distclean'.  

Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking. You can
provide additional options by modifying the appropriate *.pro files
according to qmake manual.
